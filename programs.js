Check "patch information" for each patch to see my notes on these. Patches 1-4 represent my quick dialing up of several chorus sounds which are pleasing to me.

The Power block can be placed after a Pot control to change its curve or "taper". Using increasing powers causes the controlled effect to come in "later" in the pot's rotation. Use increasing powers with "invert" and "flip" both set in the control panel to make the effect come in "sooner". Even when you are using a single control, you can process it differently for each destination if that's what you want. This allows you to fine-tune the sonic blend all along the rotation of the control pot.

Open up the control panels and adjust the sounds to your own tastes. Thousands of subtle and not- so-subtle variations are possible.

There is a tradeoff required between LFO width and LFO speed unless you are looking for sci-fi sounds. Many of the patches use a single control which turns the speed up while turning the width down to achieve a wide range of acceptable chorus sounds with a single control. This is less flexible than using separate controls, but it's entirely up to you.
In addition, the longer the chorus delay time, the less width you need to achieve a given level of detuning.`

This is similar to harmonic tremolo as found in some vintage tube amps. Harmonic tremolos may use separate filters for the high and low sections, whereas this implementation uses the high and low outputs of a single state variable filter. You could of course add a second filter so that the corner frequencies could be controlled independently. Also I'm pretty sure that harmonic tremolo varies the high and low amplitude 180 degrees out of phase with each other. This may be a better sound than having them 90 degrees apart. Nice thing is that you can experiment with all sorts of different ways of doing it.` }

        comments: { text: `Here's the idea of an oil-can delay. It uses a drum which is insulating but has a conductive outer surface. It runs through a reservoir of oil and a brush contact connected to a voltage amplifier from the input writes electrons onto the surface which are picked up by another brush on the other side of the drum. So the delay time is related to the angular displacement of the brushes and the RPM. For example if the brushes are 180 degrees apart, and it's going 60 RPM (1 rev/second) then that is a 500 msec delay. t (seconds) = (angle/360) * 60/RPM = angle / (6 * RPM). Faster the RPM, the shorter the delay.

Next there is a wobble (LFO chorus) due to the drum being off center. The rate of this corresponds to the RPM or revs per second. Faster the RPM, the faster the chorus LFO.

So we need an inverse relationship between chorus rate and delay time from one pot which controls the delay time setting. This you can see from the inverted scale going to the chorus block lfo rate input from pot1 which also goes through a smoother. The net effect of changing the scale/offset blocks (or the delay max time, or the chorus LFO max rate) is to change the angular displacement of the read and write brushes. If the specifics are important, figure it out but you can get different sounds by changing these ratios. Interestingly, the "size" of the drum makes no difference.

I used the multi-tap delay block because supposedly some oil can delays had two heads, but I'm not sure.

Pot0 = delay time/lfo rate (limited range setting, try making it longer if you like)
Pot1 = chorus width
Pot2 = feedback` }

P0 sets the delay time from long to short (about 800ms to a few ms). It also cross-fades into the
pitch-shift as it is turned up. So, when the delay gets shorter more pitch shift is available in the
feedback path.

P1 sets the feedback amount and pitch shift volume. The key to making this sound good was
being pretty aggressive with the filter on the pitch shift. With too little filtering is just sounded like
an icepick as the notes continuously jumped octaves. As is, it creates more of a sonic bed as the
octaves increase.

P2 sets the sinewave tremolo speed from 0 - slow - fast. This gets really interesting when you set the delay to slow, feedback high and trem fast. Try it!` },

This one is alot of fun with a microphone.

This one sounds very nice.  Laughing

1) Prime numbers for delay line lengths.

4) Shimmer level is controlled by feeding both the input signal
   and the reverb output into the pitch-shifter in varying amounts.
5) Pitch-shifted signal is fed into a delay line to give a couple of short delays.
   This lets the shimmer effect build up slowly in time.
6) Output is 100% wet.  Uncomment line at bottom to add dry signal.

        written_by: "Don Stavely",
        comments: { text: `;Folks who have played with the pitch-shift routine for octave-up and octave-down know about the "crossfade phase cancellation" issue.
;For octave-down, you get a tremolo effect due to the slower ramp speed (-8192). But for octave-up, the fast ramp (16384) results in an unpleasant warble.
;We can't use a longer delay than 4096, so we are stuck with it, right?

;Here is a trick I just came up with: Do two pitch shifts in a row, each shifting up by the square root of two.
;The magic ramp speed is 6783. Voila, an octave up with a pleasing tremolo instead of the warble.
;It requires another 4096 memory and 8 instructions, but still only 1 ramp (so you can still use the other for octave down, etc).

;Yes, the tradeoff is latency. In the application I am working on I am going for more of a chorus effect - i.e. multiple instruments rather than a single instrument like a 12-string.

;Notice that I write 512 words into the 4096-word delay. This reduces the latency by that amount.
;The reason you can do this is that the crossfade waveform is zero for the first 1/8th of the delay. If you try a 2048 word delay you will have to change the "wra delay1+512,0" to "wra delay1+256, 0" in both places. This is probably why it sounded worse than the standard single-step 4096 algorithm.

;Frank commented in an older thread that this trick of writing 1/8th of the way into the buffer shouldn't work.
;I assure you (and Frank) that does. It is totally glitchless, and reduces the average latency by 1/4 for free. I don't think Frank considered it carefully.
